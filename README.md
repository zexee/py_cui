This is a Python TUI framework forked from jwlodek/py_cui, but much is changed.

Checkout example/all_in_one.py for example.

TODO:
----
- use CSS-like style for widget.
- use event-based callback
- draw border/decoration and content separately, so the content can be put into another widget.
- implement linear-layout (ScrollMenu is basically linear-layout with buttons)
